LinguaPlayer in ActionScript 3.0
================================

A movie player with an embedded dictionary which runs on PC, Mac and Samsung Smart TVs. You only have to click on the subtitle words for the dictionary to show up and show the word definition to you. You can also learn the word usage and language by searching that word in the rest of the movie. This repository contains three different variants:

* A player with offline dictionary for PC/Macs
* Another one with online dictionary for PC/Macs
* And finally a player with an embedded dictionary that supports Samsung Smart TVs

In addition to all that, it's higlly customizable offers the following setting and opttions through its configuration file:

* Choosing the movie name
* Choosing the subtitle name
* Selecting a default dictionary

It also supports the following formats:

* flv: Video for Adobe Flash
* f4v: Video for Adobe Flash
* mp4: MPEG-4
* m4v: MPEG-4
* avc: MPEG-4
* mov: QuickTime Movie
* qt: QuickTime Movie
* 3gp: 3GPP for Mobile Devices
* 3gpp: 3GPP for Mobile Devices
* 3gp2: 3GPP2 for Mobile Devices
* 3gpp2: 3GPP2 for Mobile Devices
* 3g2: 3GPP2 for Mobile Devices
* srt: SubRip

This application won the title 'Best Utility App for Samsung Smart TVs' during the event SAMSUNG Smart TV Award in Iran, held by Sharif University of Technology and Samsung Electronics Co.

I may someday write the cross-platform C++ version to run on major PC and mobile platforms with extra features that I have in mind. Unfortunately, implementing those features in ActionScript seems virtually mpossible.
